I have experienced many issues uplaoding the full Lisa Street Sign database to this GitHub Repository so 
instead I will provide a link to where I downloaded it from instead.

Lisa Database (http://cvrr-nas.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html)

This dataset is 7.7GB of streetsign data both as videos and still shots from those videos.  All videos and pictures are greyscale.
