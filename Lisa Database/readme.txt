Thank you for your interest in the LISA US Traffin Sign Dataset.

The composition of the dataset can be seen in the document datasetDescription.pdf, which is a chapter from my master thesis.

All frame annotations can be found in the file allAnnotations.csv, and tools to handle them are in the tools/ folder.

The folder negatives/ contains a set of street images with no signs in them.

The rest of the folders contain tracks and frames, as well as annotations for that particular folder. Each folder contains data from a particular source video.

Any questions can be sent to andreas@moegelmose.com.
